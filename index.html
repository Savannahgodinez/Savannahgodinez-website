        <p class="lead mb-4">Growing up makeup and hair was something that always kept me entertained as a child and it brought me a lot of joy. As I grew up I still continued to really enjoy it and like it a lot. So I decided to pursue it as a career and make it into a job.I began learning how to do hair and makeup on other people to gain practie and I created an instagram to keep it as a portfolio. As time went on I eventually started to gain some clientele. That was huge for me and that was when I really decided to take into condsideration being a full time cosmetologist. So during my senior year of high school I got into and joined a ROP cosmetology program and began the process of getting my license. The requirements were a bit toughf but I managed and I am currently almost half way through my hours. We need 1600 hours of hands on cosmetology practices before we can go to statedboard and take the test to get our license. <br><br>

        Although it is a tough endeavour to achieve I still decided to follow through with it even if it meant losing out on some senior activites. Till this day I consider it one of the best decisions I have made for myself simply because it allows me to do what I love as my job. As an adult that is truly something I wanted for myself. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has the same interests as me. Also if you are interested I would love to recommend places for you to attend school.Although it is a tough endeavour to achieve I still decided to follow through with it even if it meant losing out on some senior activites.

        All in all cosmetology is truly something that I enjoy and love doing. I have about 4 years of experience now doing both makeup and hair. Once I recieve my cosmetology license I will also have an extra 1600 hours of experience to add onto the 4 years. I am very excited for the new chapter it will bring in my life and all the endeavours I will be looking forward too.All in all cosmetology is truly something that I enjoy and love doing.
